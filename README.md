### Wine Quality and Customer Dataset Analysis

#### Question 1:

- **Wine Quality Dataset:**
  - This dataset involves predicting the quality of white wines based on chemical measures.
  - 4,898 observations with 11 input variables and one output variable.
  - Variables include Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Free sulfur dioxide, Total sulfur dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol, and Quality.

- **Tasks:**
  a) Classify the dataset (20% testing) using K-NN and Decision Tree classifiers and compare their performances.
  b) For K-NN classification, fit and test the model for different values of K (from 1 to 20), recording and plotting the testing accuracy.

#### Question 2:

- **Customer Dataset:**
  - Consists of information about 381 customers and the status of their loan application result as a binary classification problem.
  
- **Tasks:**
  a) Read the dataset as a Pandas DataFrame object and consider specific columns as feature input (X) and Label output (Y).
  b) Perform necessary conversions (Label encoding and feature scaling) of appropriate features.
  c) Classify the dataset (20% test, 80% training) using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
  d) For the Decision Tree algorithm, generate and visualize the tree, and show the first and last two decision trees generated by the Random Forest classifier.
  e) Display accuracies and confusion matrices for each classifier on the test set.
  f) Determine the top three feature attributes of X based on Random Forest classification and present them as a bar graph.

#### Question 3:

- **Mall Customers Dataset:**
  - Read the CSV file "Mall_Customers.csv" as a Pandas DataFrame object.

- **Tasks:**
  a) Perform K-means Clustering (K = 5) on the dataset considering specific columns.
  b) Plot the accuracy (Elbow method) of different cluster sizes (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) to determine the best cluster size.
  c) Visualize the clustering results based on Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score, showing cluster memberships with different colors.
